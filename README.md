* This is from UPS on source forge.

Why am I doing this? A long time ago - in a galaxy far far away I used this debugger.
It was with out a doubt one of the best debuggers ever.

Sadly, it was left on the side of the road as road kill.

My goal is to resurect it... 
In some ways it is a labor of love..

To build what I am working towards: use the build.sh script.

Then my phase plans are:
	Phase 1 - Compile & link - today when I started it does not compile yet.
	Phase 2 - Plan: No warnings
	Phase 3 - Who knows...
	

Please see the file: update.md for more details on progress and set backs
