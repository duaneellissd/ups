This implementation of dwarfdump is not complete.  Among the
missing features are consumer support for .debug_macinfo and
support for .debug_loc. 

To build dwarfdump, first build libdwarf in the neighboring
directory then type
	./configure
	make

To use dwarf or libdwarf, you may want to install dwarf.h and
libdwarf.h somewhere convenient, and you may need the libdwarf
in the accompanying libdwarf directory
